# What-am-I-watching-tonight
a web based application designed to help a user choose their visual entertainment

## Description
This website is designed with the purpose of helping a user explore their options for visual entertainment. 

The user can choose from Movies or TV shows in an engaging way. The user has two main modes of choice: One being an easier choice from an available list of trending visual media. The second being a fun selection that is made for the user at random by narrowing the visual media to either Movies or TV shows based on user preference. Ideally when the user finds something of interest, they can add that current choice to a list to help them narrow down options if the first random choice isn't initially perfect. The user will also be presented with additional information about the choice before them to help them decide to watch or to go back and try another option. 

If the user has decided what visual media to consume that day, they will also find on the discovery page where they can go to watch that particular choice. Thus, by using this website, the user will have answered the enigmatic question: "What am I watching tonight?"
